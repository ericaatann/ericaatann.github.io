        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Erica Tan, a 4th year computer science major at Cal Poly Pomona, graduating Spring 2024, with a passion for technology. I'm driven by the desire to excel in both Information Technology (IT) and software development. My journey in computer science began with a fascination for solving problems and a deep curiosity about how computers work.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm dedicated to mastering the intricacies of IT systems, ensuring their smooth operation, and bolstering their security. Simultaneously, I'm enthusiastic about software development, and I aspire to create innovative solutions that leverage technology to address real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I've had the chance to build PCs and develop mobile applications. This duality of interests has led me to a holistic understanding of technology and its applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, I enjoy working out, playing musical instruments like the bamboo flute and guzheng, and pursuing a well-rounded lifestyle that complements my technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm excited to continue my journey in computer science, bridging the gap between IT and software development. I'm looking forward to collaborating on exciting projects and contributing to the ever-expanding digital landscape.
