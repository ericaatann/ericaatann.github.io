        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Erica Tan, a computer science major at Cal Poly Pomona, with a passion for technology and a strong interest in Information Technology (IT). My journey in the world of computer science started with a fascination for solving problems and a deep curiosity about how computers work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic career, I've acquired a solid foundation in programming, data structures, and algorithms. I'm enthusiastic about staying up-to-date with the latest technological advancements and trends in IT. I thrive in the dynamic and ever-evolving IT landscape, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I've had the chance to build three gaming PCs and eventually developed a passion for working with them. I am also a small tech guru at home and at work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, I enjoy working out and playing the bamboo flute and guzheng. I believe that a well-rounded approach to life complements my technical skills and contributes to a balanced perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm excited to continue my journey in computer science and IT, and I'm looking forward to collaborating on exciting projects and contributing to the ever-expanding digital landscape.
